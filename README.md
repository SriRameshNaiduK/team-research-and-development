## Project Overview  
This project explores how **involvement types** (Entry Level, Mid-Senior, Associate, Director) differ across **job designations** in LinkedIn tech job postings.  
By applying **data analysis and hypothesis testing**, it uncovers workforce dynamics and career progression patterns within the tech industry.

---

## Research Question  
> **Is there a difference in the proportions of involvement between different designations in LinkedIn tech jobs?**

---

## Methodology  

- **Dataset:** 500+ LinkedIn tech job listings from Kaggle  
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, filtering, and structuring categorical data  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - **Python:** Data preprocessing & exploratory data analysis  
  - **R:** Chi-Square Test, grouped & stacked bar charts  
  - **Trello:** Task management and workflow tracking  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Chi-Square Test of Independence
  - X² = 2368.3, df = 1173, p < 2.2e-16 → Significant relationship found

---

## Key Findings  

- Entry-level roles dominate technical designations like **Software Engineer** and **Developer**  
- Mid-senior roles are prevalent in managerial positions such as **Team Lead** and **Project Manager**  
- Highlights a **hierarchical career structure** in the tech industry

## Visualizations  

- Grouped Bar Charts (Top 4, 10, 30, 50 Designations)  
- Stacked Bar Charts for cumulative involvement comparison  
- Tools used: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyverse` in R
